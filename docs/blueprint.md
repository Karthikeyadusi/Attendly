- The use case for the app and the color 'Navy Blue' inspire the choice of colors. 'Navy Blue' typically evokes trust, efficiency, logic, knowledge and seriousness, perfect for an attendance tracker. A dark color scheme is most appropriate to ensure the app can be easily used in multiple lighting conditions.
- Primary color: '#4682B4' (Steel Blue), a medium tone color analogous to Navy Blue that creates an impression of stability and confidence.
- Background color: '#191970' (Midnight Blue), a desaturated and darkened tone that maintains the seriousness vibe. Dark scheme.
- Accent color: '#708090' (Slate Gray) for UI elements requiring more emphasis without causing distraction, ensure an ease-of-use focused application.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font offering a modern, neutral and readable look for the mobile platform.
- Use consistent and clear icons to represent subjects, attendance status (attended, absent, cancelled), and settings.
